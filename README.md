# mysql-toolset
A collection of SQL, bash, PERL, and other scripts to assist with day-to-day administration and management of MySQL instances.

## What's here?
Over the last 25 years, like most IT professionals, I've amassed a number of "helper scripts."  This repository contains and ever-growing collection of these; some dealing specifically with MySQL, others with distillations of processes to assist with operating system configuration and monitoring, quick ways of doing repetitive processes, etc.

As I clean up and document various scripts, they will be added to this repo.

NB: Files are currently arranged rather haphazardly.  This will be changing.
